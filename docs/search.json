    "text": "Why does education finance equity matter?\n\n\n\nThe longstanding and persistent reality is that vast funding inequities in our state public education systems render the education available to millions of American public school students profoundly unequal.”\n– U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 2018\n\n\n\nSchool finance equity is a critical component of educational equity overall. In an equitable school finance system, schools would receive funds they need to provide a high-quality education for all students. School funding should be based on the needs of students, not the property wealth of individual communities or a checklist of programs.\nAcross the country, almost no states have fully achieved this goal.\nInequity in school finance holds back countless other efforts to improve educational outcomes. Achieving both adequacy (enough funding) and equity (funding distributed to where it is most needed) will not solve every educational problem, but it will enable more schools to provide their students with an excellent education."

So lower wealth communities often pay taxes at a higher rate to generate less funds than their neighbors.\nAnd districts like Bridgeport with lower property wealth and higher-needs students rely on states to fill the gap. Which doesn’t always happen.\n\n\n\n\nProposals to address that challenge – changing structuring funding formulas to align with student needs rather than political clout – face huge barriers."

But this short-term pain will save you long-term agony because it forces you to capture all important interactions in your code.

But this short-term pain will save you long-term agony because it forces you to capture all important interactions in your code.

But this short-term pain will save you long-term agony because it forces you to capture all important interactions in your code. There’s nothing worse than discovering three months after the fact that you’ve only stored the results of an important calculation in your workspace, not the calculation itself in your code.”"
