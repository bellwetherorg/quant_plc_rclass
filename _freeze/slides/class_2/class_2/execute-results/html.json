Every `tidyverse` package contains functions that can manipulate or visualize data that lives in data frames.\n\n-   Most functions in the `tidyverse` require a data frame (R's version of a table) as the first argument in each function. The functions can be \"chained\" together with other functions.\n\n-   We will explore the `tidyverse` by looking at EdBuild's FY2019 education data compiled from the F33 survey, SAIPE, EDGE, and CCD. The `edbuildr` package provides access to clean district data on funding, student demographics, and wealth.\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/07/teaching-the-tidyverse-in-2020-part-1-getting-started/img/tidyverse-packages.png)\n:::\n:::\n\n## To read EdBuild's finance data into our working environment we will use the masterpull() function {.smaller .scrollable}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(edbuildr)\n\nedbuild_fin_fy19 <- masterpull(data_year = 2019, data_type = \"fin\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis code will load the `edbuildr` package and then download a clean dataframe from EdBuild's server and store it as a variable called `edbuild_fin_fy19`.\n\nThere are three options for the `data_type` argument:\n\n-   \"geo\": only includes districts with geographic boundaries (no charter/special school districts) that meet EdBuild's criteria for fiscal analysis\n-   \"fin\": includes all districts that meet EdBuild's criteria for fiscal analysis\n-   \"full\": includes all districts -- TO BE USED WITH CAUTION\n\n## The dplyr() package provides many functions to manipulate your data frames' columns and rows {.smaller .scrollable}\n\nThe functions you'll most frequently use from the dplyr packages are:\n\n-   `select()`: names columns to keep from a data frame\n-   `rename()`: name columns to keep from a data frame\n-   `filter()`: remove rows that do not meet the condition in the logical statement from the output\n-   `mutate()`: create a new column that will be added to the end of your data frame.\n\n## A special operator called a \"pipe\" will allow you to chain several functions together {.smaller .scrollable}\n\n-   In R, the pipe operator is a vertical bar and a greater-than sign: `|>`\n\n-   Instead of \"nesting\" the results of one function inside of another, the pipe allows you to execute the same command in a more human-readable order.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# example of \"nesting\" the result of one function inside another function. \ndf1 <- select(filter(raw_df, enroll > 10000), dist_id, dist_name, enroll, rev_pp)\n\n# example of using the \"pipe\" to produce the same as above \n# read the pipe as \"and then\" to understand what's being done to your data\ndf2 <- raw_df |> # start with raw_df AND THEN DO THIS \n  filter(enroll > 10000) |> # filter for enrollment > 10,000 AND THEN DO THIS \n  select(dist_id, dist_name, enroll, rev_pp) # select only these columns\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Iterative exploratory analysis\n\n## LIVE CODING EXAMPLE: exploring_the_tidyverse.R\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load ----------\n\noptions(scipen = 999)\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(edbuildr)\n\n# Krista likes to denote which spreadsheet is raw for transparency \ndist_fy19_raw <- masterpull(data_type = \"geo\")\n\n# Use the \"filter\" function to get the Minnesota data -----------\n\nmn_ed_data <- dist_fy19_raw |>\n  filter(State == \"Minnesota\") \n\n# Use \"rename\" function to change names of Minnesota variables --------\n\nmn_ed_data <- mn_ed_data |>\n  rename(district = NAME,\n         county = County,\n         enroll = ENROLL, \n         total_local_rev = LR) \n\n# Use \"mutate\" function to create a local revenue pp variable -----\nmn_ed_data <- mn_ed_data |>\n  mutate(local_rev_pp = total_local_rev/enroll) \n\n# Use \"select\" function to choose the variables you want in your data frame ---------\n\nmn_ed_data <- mn_ed_data |>\n  select(district, county, enroll, total_local_rev, local_rev_pp)\n\n# Filter the districts that do not have enrollment ------\n\nmn_ed_data_clean <- mn_ed_data |>\n  filter(enroll > 0)\n```\n:::\n\n\n# Small Group Work\n\n## In pairs, you will work together to create a clean data frame for a state. \n\n- **Julia and Kelly:** Illinois\n- **Indira and Priyanka:** Tennessee\n- **Marisa and Brian:** Maryland \n- **Ebony and Libby:** Virginia \n- **Sophie and Nora:** Alabama \n\nKrista and Alex will be circulating to the different pairs to answer questions and\noffer support. \n\n# Next Class and Homework \n\n## Coming Up {.smaller .scrollable}\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n**Next Class**\n\n-   The next class will be **Tuesday, April 23 from 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM CT.**\n\n-   We will do a deep dive into the `ggplot2` and do basic data visualization in R. \n\n-   We will use our clean data frames that we made today to do the data visualization. \n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\n**Homework** \n\n-   Finish cleaning and creating the data frame for your assigned state. \n\n-   In the \"homework\" folder you will find a raw data frame and a script with instructions. Please complete the homework and push updates to the repository by 11:00 AM CT on Monday, April 21. Krista will look it over and provide comments. \n\n-   **Optional homework:** Find a raw data frame that you want to clean. Add it to the \"optional_hw\" folder\" and use the four functions we learned about today to create a clean data frame. \n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
