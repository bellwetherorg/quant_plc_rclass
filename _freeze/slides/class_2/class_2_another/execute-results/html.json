Every `tidyverse` package contains functions that can manipulate or visualize data that lives in data frames.\n\n-   Most functions in the `tidyverse` require a data frame (R's version of a table) as the first argument in each function. The functions can be \"chained\" together with other functions.\n\n-   We will explore the `tidyverse` by looking at EdBuild's FY2019 education data compiled from the F33 survey, SAIPE, EDGE, and CCD. The `edbuildr` package provides access to clean district data on funding, student demographics, and wealth.\n:::\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n## To read EdBuild's finance data into our working environment we will use the masterpull() function\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(edbuildr)\n\nedbuild_fin_fy19 <- masterpull(data_year = 2019, data_type = \"fin\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis code will load the `edbuildr` package and then download a clean dataframe from EdBuild's server and store it as a variable called `edbuild_fin_fy19`.\n\nThere are three options for the `data_type` argument:\n\n-   \"geo\": only includes districts with geographic boundaries (no charter/special school districts) that meet EdBuild's criteria for fiscal analysis\n-   \"fin\": includes all districts that meet EdBuild's criteria for fiscal analysis\n-   \"full\": includes all districts -- TO BE USED WITH CAUTION\n\n## The dplyr() package provides many functions to manipulate your data frames' columns and rows\n\nThe functions you'll most frequently use from the dplyr packages are:\n\n-   `select()`: names columns to keep from a data frame\n-   `rename()`: name columns to keep from a data frame\n-   `filter()`: remove rows that do not meet the condition in the logical statement from the output\n-   `mutate()`: create a new column that will be added to the end of your data frame.\n\n## A special operator called a \"pipe\" will allow you to chain several functions together\n\n-   In R, the pipe operator is a vertical bar and a greater-than sign: `|>`\n\n-   Instead of \"nesting\" the results of one function inside of another, the pipe allows you to execute the same command in a more human-readable order.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# example of \"nesting\" the result of one function inside another function. \ndf1 <- select(filter(raw_df, enroll > 10000), dist_id, dist_name, enroll, rev_pp)\n\n# example of using the \"pipe\" to produce the same as above \n# read the pipe as \"and then\" to understand what's being done to your data\ndf2 <- raw_df |> # start with raw_df AND THEN DO THIS \n  filter(enroll > 10000) |> # filter for enrollment > 10,000 AND THEN DO THIS \n  select(dist_id, dist_name, enroll, rev_pp) # select only these columns\n```\n:::\n",
